## 📋 Quick Start

### Current Status: ✅ Data Ready → 🔄 Algorithm Development

This project provides an AI-driven solution for Kochi Metro's nightly trainset induction planning. The data foundation is complete with 365 realistic records across 6 operational dimensions.

### Get Started:

1. **Review**: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for complete context
2. **Implement**: Follow `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for step-by-step development
3. **Data**: Use `ArtificialData/` folder (25 trainsets, 10 users, 365 total records)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Automate the complex nightly decision process for 25 Kochi Metro trainsets
**Variables**: 6 interdependent factors (fitness, maintenance, branding, mileage, cleaning, stabling)
**Goal**: Transform manual, error-prone operations into optimized, explainable AI decisions

## 🚀 Next Steps (AI Agent Context)

### **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY** (Next 6 hours):

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline** → Load and validate CSV data
2. **Optimization Engine** → Implement NSGA-II for multi-objective planning
3. **Constraint System** → Validate fitness, maintenance, operational rules
4. **Explanation Engine** → Generate human-readable decision rationale
5. **Basic Interface** → Display results and recommendations

### **Core Objectives to Optimize**:

- **Service Readiness** (maximize operational trainsets)
- **Maintenance Cost** (minimize operational expenses)
- **Branding Exposure** (meet advertising contract commitments)

### **Critical Constraints**:

- Fitness certificate validity (hard constraint)
- Open job card restrictions (safety-critical)
- Bay assignment feasibility (physical limitations)
